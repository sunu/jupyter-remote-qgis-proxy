# Unfortunately the version of websockify on PyPI doesn't include the [compiled
# wrapper library](https://github.com/novnc/websockify#wrap-a-program) which is
# used by this extension, so either you'd have to manually compile it after pip
# installing websockify, or use the conda package.

channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - jupyterhub-singleuser
  - pip
  - websockify
